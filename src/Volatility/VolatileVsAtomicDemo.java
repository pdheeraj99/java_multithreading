package Volatility;

/**
 * The whiteboard analogy helps visualize:

	Volatile = everyone can see the current value (glasses on)
	Atomic = only one person can change the value at a time (exclusive marker)
 * 
 * 
 * VolatileVsAtomicDemo.java
 * 
 * CONCEPT: Volatile vs Atomic Operations
 * -------------------------------------
 * 
 * VOLATILE:
 * - Ensures visibility of changes across threads (memory consistency)
 * - Does NOT make operations atomic
 * - Changes made by one thread are immediately visible to all threads
 * - Does not prevent race conditions for compound operations
 * 
 * ATOMICITY:
 * - Operations that complete in a single, uninterruptible step
 * - Cannot be interfered with by other threads
 * - Ensures that compound operations (like read-modify-write) are treated as one unit
 * - Provided by classes in java.util.concurrent.atomic or synchronized blocks
 * 
 * REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
 * 
 * Imagine a whiteboard in an office (shared variable):
 * 
 * VOLATILE is like ensuring everyone has their glasses on to see the board:
 * - Everyone can SEE what's currently on the whiteboard
 * - But two people might try to update it at the same time
 * - Person A reads "5", adds 1, starts writing "6"
 * - Person B also reads "5", adds 1, also writes "6"
 * - Final result is 6, not 7 (lost update)
 * 
 * ATOMIC is like having a marker that only one person can hold at a time:
 * - Only the person with the marker can update the whiteboard
 * - Person A gets marker, reads "5", adds 1, writes "6", puts marker down
 * - Person B waits, then gets marker, reads "6", adds 1, writes "7"
 * - Final result is correctly 7

 /* DEEPER UNDERSTANDING:
 
	 1. The Increment Problem (x++) is a 3-step operation:
		 - READ the current value
		 - ADD 1 to it
		 - WRITE the new value
		 This creates a window where another thread can interfere.
	 
	 2. Volatile guarantees:
		 - Changes are visible immediately to other threads
		 - Prevents compiler optimizations that could reorder operations
		 - DOES NOT make compound operations atomic
	 
	 3. Atomic classes provide:
		 - Operations that cannot be interrupted
		 - Methods like incrementAndGet() that do entire read-modify-write as one unit
		 - Better performance than synchronized in many cases
	 
	 4. When to use volatile:
		 - For simple flags where you only write once (e.g., isRunning = false)
		 - When you only need visibility but not atomicity
		 - For reference variables that you want to be visible when changed
		 
	 5. When to use atomic:
		 - For counters that are updated by multiple threads
		 - When you need atomic read-modify-write operations
		 - For compare-and-set operations
		 
	 6. When to use synchronized:
		 - For more complex operations involving multiple variables
		 - When you need to ensure several operations happen together
		 - For general thread safety of methods
