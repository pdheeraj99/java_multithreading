1. Internally ExecutorService is using LinkedBlockingQueue

2. For executorService.shutdown()
By manually doing shutdown it will terminate all the threads in the threadPool. otherwise the threads keep on running.
If you didnt keep below line the threads keep on running

3. Difference between Fixed Thread Pool and Cached Thread Pool ?
FixedThreadPool vs CachedThreadPool

FixedThreadPool ðŸ”’

Threads: Fixed number (set by you).

Use case: Steady workload (e.g., processing consistent tasks).

Creates the fixed number of threads and use those fixed threads  even though heavy or low
workload

Behavior: Queues tasks if busy.

CachedThreadPool ðŸš€

Threads: Grows/shrinks automatically.

Use case: Many short tasks (e.g., handling spikes in requests).

Behavior: Creates new threads if busy, kills idle ones after 60s.

Creates the threads based on demand but if existing threads are free it will reuse the same
thread again and shrinks and if demand increases again creates threads and use those

TL;DR: Use Fixed for stability, Cached for flexibility
